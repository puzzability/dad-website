<div id="aboutText">
<p>Robert Leighton is a writer who draws. He writes puzzles (frequently his own brand of one-of-a-kind visual puzzles), cartoons (for the New Yorker and the Wall Street Journal), and comics (for Nickelodeon Magazine and SpongeBob comics). He has illustrated books on everything from puberty to procrastination to poop. </p> <br/><br/><br/><br/>

﻿
<p>While attending Northwestern&rsquo;s Medill School of Journalism, Robert created the comic strip Banderooge, whose title character remains the unofficial mascot of his graduating class. Robert then went on to become an editor at Games magazine and a writer for Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, and CBS. We&rsquo;re probably leaving stuff out, but you get the idea.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>

​
<p>There are other Robert Leightons. The Internet is full of them. But only this one was actually on To Tell the Truth, which means that when the question was asked: &ldquo;Will the real Robert Leighton please stand up?&rdquo; this was the guy who stood up.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>

​
<p>He&rsquo;s still standing, often next to his wife Valerie, his son Kyle, and his dog Madison.​</p><br/><br/><br/><br/>
